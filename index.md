# Engineering Python Course Overview  

### Introduction <br>
* Computers are being increasingly used in almost every engineering and science discipline.
* Computer programming has become an important skill that is highly desired by employers in various industries.
* This course introduces computer programming, with an emphasis on its applications in engineering.
* It swiftly brings novice students to a level where they can use the programming skills to (1) assist the learning of other math and engineering methodology courses, (2) analyze data for lab reports, capstone projects, and (3) showcase their qualification when they are involved in faculty members' research or when they get a job.  <br> <br>


### Why Python? <br>
* This course focuses on teaching and solidifying a foundation for a single programming language, **Python**. This concentration allows students to gain a deeper understanding of its full capabilities.
* Python is an object-oriented generic programming language that is specially suited for modern software design.
